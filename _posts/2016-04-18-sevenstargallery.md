SevenStarGallery

SevenStar Gallery owned by artist / mime / dancer Thorsten Heinze presents photography featuring contemporary works from the gallery's private collection by Will McBride, Donata Wenders, Joachim Baldauf, Peter Brüchmann, J

ürgen Loevenich, Helga Kneidl, Peter Nuremberg and young talents such as Peter Lorenz. Their pictures show private, non-public moments of great pop and cinema icons from the past 30 years like Klaus Kinski, Hildegars Knef, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Sharon Tate, Jimi Hendrix, Claudia Schiffer and many others. All pictures are black & white silver gelatin prints in large format, only available in editions of one to nine.

A SevenStar Gallery picture is made in museum quality meeting Zeitgeist and moreover it veils and reveals both - The visible refers to the invisible. Still there is more to be discovered. Not only within the pictures but also in the gallery itself.
